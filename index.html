<p>Hi, my name is Janelle Zhao.

I am currently a graphic design student (graduating in 2019). Before this, I obtained a BA in psychology and worked in marketing and branding for tech startups for 4 years.
I am passionate about creating delightful experiences for people through design. Portfolio coming soon!</p>
